1.	WAP that shows the use of Base and this keyword with constructor in Inheritance, also show how memory allocation is done from base class to derive class and deallocation is done from derive class to base class.

2.	Create a property and set their values (integer) on condition that they should not be    negative. Also Create read only property and write only property also.

3.	Write a program that create a namespace First with a class abc having three integer members i, j, k. These members are declared Public. Create another namespace Second with a class xyz and use namespace First and class abc in it. This program should assign the values 40, 50, 60 to the three integer members of class abc. Finally display the sum and product of these numbers.

4.	Create a class Called Car. Declare method Color() and Price(). Accept the color of the car in and price of the car from user. Now create another class called Vehicles. Restrict the class Car from being inherited in class Vehicles?

5.	Show the compile time and runtime (dynamic) polymorphism.

6.	Create an abstract base class titled ‘Shapes’. It should contain a method Area () which returns area of a particular shape. Derive two classes from Shapes titled Rectangle and triangle. Implement the method Area () in both classes to print the area.    

7.	Create an abstract class (Bank) which has both types of methods: abstract and non-abstract. The names of the methods will be interest and display respectively. Now create four more classes called ICICI, SBI, PNB, and ABNAMRO. These classes should define the rate of interest for abstract class and also implement the display method.
