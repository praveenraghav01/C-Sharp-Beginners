# C-Sharp-Beginners

1.	Create a Interface ICalculator having some method(add/subtract/divide/multiply) for calculator. Create a class Calculator which implements this ICalculator. Then call them with a menu driven program for different operations like (add/subtract/divide/multiply/exit).

2.	Write a program where an interface inherits another interface.

3.	Define a person class with three data members: age, name and gender.
a.	Derive a class called employee from person that adds a data member code to store employee code
b.	Derive another class called specialist from employee which store specialization of employee.
4.	Create Class Savings Account. Use static variable annual Interest Rate to store the interest rate for all account holders. Each object of the class contains a private instance variable savings Balance indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit. Provide function Calculate Monthly Interest to calculate the monthly interest by multiplying the savings Balance by annual Interest Rate divided by 12; this interest should be added to savings Balance. Provide a static function Modify Interest Rate that sets the annual Interest Rate to a new value. Write a driver program to test class Savings Account. Instantiate two savings Account objects, saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set annual Interest Rate to 4%, then calculate the monthly interest and print the new balances for each of the savers. Then set the annual Interest Rate to 5% and calculate the next monthâ€™s interest and print the new balances for each of the savers.
